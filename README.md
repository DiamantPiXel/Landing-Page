								.....LANDING PAGE PROJECT.....

	1. BACKGROUND
		
		Moving forward in the Odin Project's foundation courses, after completing all of the flex box assigments, now creating from scratch
		with almost no support or advices a landing page for an internet website. The page's layout and design is provided by an still 
		jpg-picture of TOP, and the participant is expected to make manually an (not necesserally perfect) copy of it.

	....................

	2. STRUCTURE
		
		The landing page is made of 4 main elements:
			
			A head section
			
			A information section
			
			A quote section

			A sign up section

			And finally a foot section

	...................

	3. OUTCOME

		I managed to imitate the template almost perfectly, although I didn't include pictures in the empty boxes as suggested by TOP, 
		because I didn't see it as technically necessary. 

		It took around ten hours to finish the project. The work was completed on October 24th, 2025, at 12 p.m.
