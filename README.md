								.....LANDING PAGE PROJECT.....

	1. BACKGROUND
		
		Moving forward in the Odin Project's foundation courses, after completing all of the Flexbox lessons, now creating from scratch
		with almost no support or advices a landing page for an internet website. The page's layout and design is provided by an still 
		jpg-picture from TOP, and the participant is expected to manually make a (not necesserally perfect) copy of it.

	....................

	2. STRUCTURE
		
		The landing page is made of 4 main elements:
			
			A head section
			
			A information section
			
			A quote section

			A sign up section

			And finally a foot section

	...................

	3. OUTCOME

		I managed to imitate the template almost perfectly, although I didn't include pictures in the empty boxes as suggested by TOP, 
		because I didn't see it as technically necessary. 

		I wasn't able to make the landing page's layout responsive to different screen sizes, since the corresponding lessons teaching this
		functionality comes later on in the TOP curriculum. Expect therefore varying display results of this project depending on your 
		screen size or device. To obtain the intended look of the landing page on Xubuntu, you will have to have a screen resolution 
		of 4096X2160 and a scale value on the x and y axis of 0.7.  

		It took around ten hours to finish the project. The work was completed on October 24th, 2025, at 12 p.m.
